Nigeria's opposition leader on Wednesday rejected the re-election of President Muhammadu Buhari in a delayed poll plagued by claims of rigging, vowing to challenge the "sham" result in court. "If I had lost in a free and fair election, I would have called the victor within seconds of my being aware of his victory to offer not just my congratulations, but my services to help unite Nigeria by being a bridge between the North and the South," Atiku Abubakar said in a statement. "Consequently, I hereby reject the result of the February 23, 2019 sham election and will be challenging it in court."   Muhammadu Buhari triumphs with some 15.2 million votes over his nearest rival Atiku Abubakar. KPRL board is opposed to the renewal of KPC 3-year lease that expires in March.
