A Nyeri court in central Kenya on Friday released three suspects held in connection to the Al-Shabaab attack on the dusitD2 complex in Nairobi, citing police findings. Resident Magistrate Nelly Kariuki made the ruling after the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit requested to withdraw the case saying the investigations revealed no links to the incident. Cyprian Gitonga Muthoga, an inspector in charge of crimes at the ATPU, said the suspects could not be directly linked to the January 15 assault that left 21 people dead. “We have completed the investigations in liaison with the ATPU and from the findings, no offence has been disclosed," Mr Muthoga told the magistrate. "We wish to withdraw the miscellaneous application that sought to continue holding the suspects and close the file." Remand The suspects - Mr Abdul Kibiringi, Mr James Mwai Mwangi and Ms Habiba Gedi Hunshur - had been remanded in custody by the court on Monday to allow detectives complete their probe. The trio had been arrested on Friday night in Nyeri's Majengo slums and Kangemi village. Police alleged they had conspired to commit terrorism and had been in contact with the Dusit attackers. During their arraignment on Monday, Mr Kibiringi complained that he had been arrested because of his son who went missing more than two years ago. “I was arrested while taking tea at a kiosk in town. Police told me I was wanted because of my missing son who is 26 years old and suspected to be connected to the attack," he said. "There is no need to have me in custody," he added, but the court declined to release him.
