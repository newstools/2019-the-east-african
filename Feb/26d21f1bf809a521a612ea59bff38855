Police in Ugandan capital Kampala are investigating an alleged robbery and rape at a local bank. Authorities say four unidentified men armed with an AK47 rifle stormed the Development Finance Company of Uganda Bank (DFCU) branch on Sir Apollo Kaggwa Road at 7pm on Monday evening. The gang reportedly ordered three bank staff who were winding up the day's business to lead them to the safe where cash is kept. They assaulted the trio demanding for the keys to the safe in vain.

Stolen car Outside the bank, the robbers hijacked a Toyota Vitz belonging to one of the employees that was parked at the entrance. Police said the attackers abandoned the vehicle in Busega, some 6km southwest from the bank, and vanished. Detectives suspect that two guards attached to Securex security firm deployed to guard the bank were part of the robbery plan. The two guards, who Securex has only identified as Francis E and Alfred K, are said to be on the run after dumping their guns outside the bank. Mr Luke Owoyesigyire, the deputy Kampala Metropolitan Police spokesman, said a hunt for the security guards was on. Treatment “The information we are getting is that they tried all they can to get access to the safe but they failed. The hunt is on and we're able to establish that one vehicle registration UAX 992N was stolen and abandoned in Busega but investigations are ongoing,” Mr Owoyesigyire said. The employee who was reportedly raped has since been admitted at Norvik Hospital on Buganda Road in Kampala. In a statement, the bank managers Tuesday said the affected staff were receiving medical attention and counselling. As a result of the attempted robbery, they said, the bank is reviewing the security measures in place. “Several armed men ambushed our staff as they were closing up to leave the branch after work. Unfortunately, during the attack, some of our employees were physically assaulted. We are doing everything to ensure they get back to their feet as quickly as possible,” reads the statement. The bank branch remained closed Tuesday as investigations continue. “In the meantime, customers are being served at the Makerere and Kawempe branches which are the closest in proximity,” the statement shared on their social media platforms further reads.
