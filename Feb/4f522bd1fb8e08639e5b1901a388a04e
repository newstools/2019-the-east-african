South Africa's Durban University of Technology (DUT) has suspended lectures in five of its campuses following a fresh wave of protests at the institution. Protests flared up at the campuses across the coastal city Durban from Sunday evening, as students demanded justice for their slain colleague, Mr Mlungisi Madonsela. Mr Madonsela was shot following an altercation with security personnel at the campus two weeks ago as students protested over grievances including safety, funding and accommodation. The DUT Vice-Chancellor, Prof Thandwa Mthembu, said the decision to suspend classes was taken to “ensure safety and security of staff and students”. Take lightly He said there had been ‘serious’ threats made by the Student Representative Council (SRC), which they did not take lightly. “The decision was reached following renewed student protests in Durban, while engagements between university management and the SRC was taking place," said Prof Mthembu. "Although the suspension of the academic programme in Durban is disappointing, the university cannot jeopardise the safety and security of all staff and students," he added. The protesters on Monday disrupted classes and intimidated staff and students. Fake news “The protesters also violated the rights of others by publicly issuing threats against members of the DUT community,” read a DUT statement. Prof Mthembu blamed the student leaders, saying they were not willing to negotiate a lasting solution. “It would seem that some student leaders in Durban are not interested in agreements that take us closer to solutions. It is this group that is spreading fake news, issuing threats and promoting disruption and disorder in Durban,” said Prof Mthembu. The DUT executive committee was holding meetings with the SRC, while the five campuses remained.   Govt spokesman accuses executives of providing backend access to unauthorised persons.
