The three-day official tour that began on Tuesday is President Bio's first to Gambia since assuming office. President Bio is accompanied by First Lady Fatima Bio, who has a Gambian heritage. A statement from the presidency in Freetown said the tour was geared towards deepening bilateral relations and to honour an invitation extended by President Adama Barrow.

The Gambian leader in April 2017 visited Freetown as part of a thank you tour following the peaceful resolution of his country’s electoral crisis. Sierra Leone’s then President Ernest Bai Koroma was a leading player in the process. Gambia and Sierra Leone share a long history of political ties, stemming from the colonial period when the same British governors presided over the affairs of both countries.
