Queues formed outside banks in the Zimbabwean capital Harare on Friday as the central bank opened trading of a new currency, a Reuters witness said. Zimbabweâ€™s central bank announced on Wednesday that it would scrap the peg between its quasi-currency bond note and the US dollar, creating a new currency from the bond notes and notional electronic dollars that will be known as RTGS dollars. The central bank sold banks US dollars at a rate of 2.5 RTGS dollars on Friday morning, governor John Mangudya said.   Zimbabwe abandoned its currency after it spiralled out of control between 2008 and 2009. Nearly seven million people face extreme hunger. The soldiers will be deployed to missions where the US sees as high-priority.
