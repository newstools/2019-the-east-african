India's Bharti Airtel on Friday saidÂ its unit, Airtel Networks Kenya Ltd, has agreed to merge with Telkom Kenya Ltd, the country's smallest telecom operator. Last month, three industry sources said that Bharti Airtel was in talks to buy Telkom Kenya, to create a stronger challenger to market leader Safaricom. The companies will combine their respective mobile, enterprise and carrier services businesses in Kenya to operate as Airtel-Telkom, Airtel said, without revealing further details. Telkom Kenya is majority owned (60 percent) by the UK-based private equity firm Helios Investment Partners. The Kenyan government owns 40 percent.   Either a marriage of convenience or a buyout is on the cards, after similar talks collapsed last year. The team was released on police bond.
