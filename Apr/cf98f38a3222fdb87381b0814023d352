In the category of Social Inclusion, the award went to Badiaa Bouhrizi, a singer-songwriter and composer from Tunisia, who has used her musical talent to promote social justice and the values of pluralism and democracy.   Decision prompted by increased competition for resources in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. Lack of political will remains at the centre of the funding.
