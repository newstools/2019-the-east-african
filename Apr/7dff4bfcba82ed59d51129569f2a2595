Jonathan Toroitich Moi, the son of former Kenyan president Daniel Moi has died. He died Friday evening in Nakuru, a town 160km southeast of Nairobi, ex-president Moi's Press Secretary Lee Njiru confirmed Saturday. It was not immediately clear what caused Mr Toroitich's death. In a brief telephone interview with Nation, Mr Njiru said the family will issue a detailed statement on Sunday. “I have been asked by the Moi family to tell Kenyans to respect their privacy at this mourning period of their beloved kin,” said Mr Njiru. Mr Toroitich was a celebrated Safari Rally driver.   Years ago, Easter holidays meant one thing in Kenya, the Safari Rally and it is a coincidence that Mr Toroitich has died during the Easter holiday. Mr Toroitich's brother, Baringo Senator Gideon Moi, said Saturday, "Jonathan will be remembered for his daring exploits in the racing tracks, in muddy and dusty tracks, during this time of Easter." Mr Toroitich was also a prominent farmer and involved in real estate business. Former president Moi has eight children, five sons and three daughters. They are, Gideon, Philip Moi (a retired army officer) and his twin Doris Elizabeth Chepkorir, Jennifer, June, Raymond Moi, who is Rongai MP and John Mark. Their mother Lena Moi died in 2004.   Former President Daniel Moi's Press Secretary Lee Njiru confirms. With farming yet to recover, more than half the population faces severe food shortages. Both countries are said to be working behind closed doors to end the impasse.
