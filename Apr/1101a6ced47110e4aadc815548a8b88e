The latest 2019 recipient, Chef Mutaro Balde from Guinea Bissau, is the executive chef and general manager for Le Comptoir Group in Hong Kong. It was therefore a dream come true to experience a fine dining experience at Ubumwe Grande curated by him. There was excitement in the air as guests from the YPO Africa Great Lakes Chapter lounged on black and white patterned chairs. The rooftop restaurant offered a scenic birdâ€™s-eye view of the city with the night lights dotting the view. Ubumwe Grande's staff efficiently waited on the guests. After the welcome drinks, diners adjourned to the dining area with sweeping chandeliers. Inspiration from across Rwanda was sprinkled into the special menu for the day. The Dar es Salaam jumbo prawn was rich with flavour from the lemon butter sauce. It was served with chicken sausage, giving it a sweet and savoury taste. The side of beetroot tartar and the rice crackers gave a slightly sweet finish, which was accompanied by a glass of Laurent Perrier champagne. Isombe (cassava leaves) were on the vegetarian menu. Isombe puree, which is a favourite among locals, was served with a slight variation to give it an exotic feel. The puree had cinnamon and cardamom flavours, and was served with fresh seasonal vegetables and buttery fondant potatoes. The vegetarian option was accompanied by a Domaine de la Baume Chardonnay. Dessert was a moist chocolate cake with crumb and chocolate ganache, and a creamy chocolate garnish with a cherry on top. Chef Balde used locally sourced ingredients, save for the prawns from Dar es Salaam, and the meal was influenced by European and Asian cuisine.   Decision prompted by increased competition for resources in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. Lack of political will remains at the centre of the funding.
