Protests that erupted in Sudan in December over a hike in bread prices quickly escalated into nationwide demonstrations demanding that President Omar al-Bashir end his 30-year grip on power. The protests have since Saturday been focused on the military's headquarters in Khartoum where thousands of people have been camped out to call on the army for support. After state media said the military would make an important announcement imminently, here is a timeline of the uprising, which has claimed dozens of lives.   Thousands chant "the regime has fallen" as they flood the area around army headquarters. Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir has been removed from power and detained by the army. Consultations are under way to set up a transitional council to run the country.
