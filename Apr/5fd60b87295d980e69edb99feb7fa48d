Algerian lawmakers on Tuesday named upper house speaker Abdelkader Bensalah as interim president, state television reported, following the resignation of Abdelaziz Bouteflika in the face of mass protests. The move by parliament follows constitutional rules but goes against the demands of demonstrators, who have pushed for Bensalah and other top politicians to stand down.   The 82-year-old said last month he would pull out of the race and postponed April elections. Political initiatives have helped to boost development and investor confidence.
