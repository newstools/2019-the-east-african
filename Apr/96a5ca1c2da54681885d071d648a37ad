According to Vodacom, no formal charges have been preferred against these employees yet, but “they may appear in Court, later today (Wednesday)”. In June 2018, two chief executives of mobile phone companies were charged with fraud as part of a crackdown against tax evasion. Le Van Dai, managing director of Halotel Tanzania and Sherif El Barbary, managing director of Zanzibar Telecom Company (Zantel) were charged alongside four other suspects with conspiracy, fraud and tax evasion, causing the government losses of more than Tsh1.2 billion ($530,000). The offences included use of unregistered SIM cards, operating without licence, illegally importing and installing communications equipment, and fraudulent use of telecommunication networks. Vodacom said the recent developments will not have an impact on service delivery as “measures have been taken to ensure that the company’s operations continue free of interruptions and disruptions”.   Vodacom says govt declined Sylvia Mulinge's application. Ugandan soldiers are hunting the gunmen who abducted the pair on Tuesday.
