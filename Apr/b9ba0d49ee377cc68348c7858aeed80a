Tanzania's Energy and Water Utilities Regulatory Authority has increased retail and wholesale prices for petrol and diesel imported through the port of Dar es Salaam. Kerosene prices remain unchanged in the latest review of pump prices. Ewura acting director-general Nzinyangwa Mchany attributed the price review into an increase in the world oil prices. For the month of April 2019, retail prices of petrol increased by Tsh49 ($0.02115) per litre and diesel by Tsh61 ($0.02633) per litre. The wholesale price of petrol went up by Tsh49.03 ($0.02116) per litre, a 2.48 per cent increase, while diesel rose by Tsh 60.86 ($0.02627) a litre, an increase of 3.03 per cent. In Dar es Salaam, petrol now costs Tsh2,147 ($0.92667) per litre while diesel costs Tsh2,192 ($0.94609). In Arusha, a litre of petrol costs Tsh2,192 ($0.946090) and diesel Tsh2,196 ($0.94782). In Dodoma, the pump price of petrol is Tsh2,206 ($0.95213) and diesel Tsh2,250 ($0.97112). Ewura said there were no new consignments of petroleum products imported through Tanga and Mtwara ports in the past month, therefore the prices in the northern and southern regions will remain the same as last month. But there has been an adjustment of Tsh0.83 ($0.00036) per litre of petrol and Tsh0.91 ($0.00039) per litre of diesel after a revision of demurrage charges that were not correctly captured in March.   Changes in prices pegged on world oil market prices and an increases in the basis point premiums. Journalists at Eye Radio have been forced to cower as bullets flew outside their studios.
