Uganda Airlines is set to make its maiden direct flight from Entebbe to Mombasa next week, a move authorities are banking on to help boost trade and tourism between Kenya and the neighbouring country. The carrier’s Bombardier aircraft is expected to touch down at Mombasa International Airport with 76 passengers on November 11 at 1pm, making it the seventh destination since it resumed operations in August 27 this year. Uganda Airlines will fly to Mombasa three times a week on Monday, Friday and Sunday. The airline says the one-hour 50-minute trips will target tourists and Ugandan traders who depend on the port of Mombasa to do business since most of the country’s imports pass through the port. “We expect to make first flight on Monday next week with 76 passengers on board. We are working with different stakeholders including the Kenya Tourism Board, hoteliers and travelling agents to ensure the airline rules the skies,” Uganda Airlines sales manager Kenya Lenny Malasi said. Initially, promotional tickets will cost about Ksh20,000 ($200) one-way after which ticket prices will depend on demand. The carrier says it plans to increase the flights per week in the next three months. “We are flying to Nairobi, Dar es Salam, Juba, Mogadishu, Bujumbura and Kilimanjaro. We hope to increase our number of flights per week in such towns in the near future,” he said.   Rwandan govt says it will not interfere with judicial process. Burundian president says objectives of his tenure, including peace have been met.
