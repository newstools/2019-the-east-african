A decline in cashewnut exports has seen Tanzania's trade earning reduce to $563.5 million in the year ending September, from $1 billion in the same period in 2018. According to the Bank of Tanzania’s (BoT) monthly economic review for October, the decrease in cashewnuts exports is attributed to a drop in prices in the world market and reduced volumes after a government initiative to safeguard farmers’ earnings. The BoT review estimates that about 90,000 tonnes of cashewnuts stock from the 2018/2019 season were exported in August and September.

Ho However, the report shows that the value of goods and services exports rose by 5.2 per cent to $9 billion due to an increase in the services receipts and value of non-traditional exports—which are all products other than cocoa beans, logs and lumber, unprocessed gold and other minerals, and electricity. Exports of non-traditional goods increased to $4 billion from $3 billion the previous year. Earnings from all major categories of non-traditional exports increased, except for fish and fish products. Exports of manufactured goods increased by 32.6 per cent to $1 billion, driven by sisal products, iron and steel, glass and glassware, manufactured tobacco and fertilisers. Capital goods imports—mostly for infrastructure projects— grew by 21.6 per cent to $3.8 billion. Oil imports, which accounted for 22.5 per cent of imports, increased by 15.8 per cent to $2 billion.
