Pan-African fuel retailer Vivo Energy has announced the exit of Joe Muganda as the managing director of its Kenyan business effective November 30, 2019. Mr. Muganda has been at the helm of Vivo Energy Kenya for barely two years since his appointment on February 1, 2018. He will be replaced by Peter Murungi who takes up the new role on December 1, 2019. In a statement Tuesday, the firm said Muganda had decided to leave the business at the end of November. However, it did not disclose more details on the planned exit. “I would like to thank Joe for the contribution he has made as MD of Vivo Energy Kenya, and wish him well for the future. I am certain that Peter will build on this success to steer the organisation to even greater achievements,” said Hans Paulsen, Vivo Energy’s Executive Vice President in-charge of the East &Southern Africa region. Mr. Muganda joined the oil business from Nation Media Group, where he had been the Managing Director since July 2015. Vivo Energy, which operates under the Shell and Engen brands, currently has operations in 23 African markets including Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda. Other countries are Botswana, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Cote D’Ivoire, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Reunion, Senegal, Tunisia, Zambia and Zimbabwe. According to Vivo Energy, Mr Peter Murungi brings a wealth of experience to the role of the Chief Executive, having worked for Vivo Energy and Shell since 2007 and most recently leading the Group’s implementation of a new Enterprise Resource Planning system. Mr Murungi joined Shell Kenya in 2007 where he worked as a Depot Manager in both Nairobi and Mombasa. In 2011 he transferred to Vivo Energy’s operations in Namibia, initially as Supply and Distribution Manager, and then became the Supply and Marketing Manager in 2013.   The transaction is still subject to regulatory approvals.
