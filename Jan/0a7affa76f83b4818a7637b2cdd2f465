There is no damage to the aircraft and it is being towed to the ramp,” the airlines said in a statement. “An alternative flight is being arranged to complete the return flight and rebook the passengers, who were booked to travel from Entebbe to Addis Ababa,” the statement added. The carrier said it was investigating the cause of the incident. Ethiopian Airlines is Africa's largest airline by profit and revenue, according to International Air Transport Association (IATA).
