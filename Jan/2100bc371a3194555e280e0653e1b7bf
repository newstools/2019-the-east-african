Tanzanian President John Magufuli Tuesday appointed a new Minister for Minerals Mr Dotto Biteko, promoting him from a deputy position in the ministry.

Ms Kairuki has been moved to the Office of the Prime Minister as the Minister of State for Investment. Mr Biteko lead a parliamentary committee that probed the mining sector that tabled a report in September 2017 showing rampant smuggling of minerals and widespread tax evasion. The government has since overhauled its laws in the mining sector to enable it get more revenues from its vast mineral resources.   Mining now contributes around 4.8 per cent to the GDP, up from 3.5 per cent. Calm has returned to the Gabonese capital after several hours of upheaval.
