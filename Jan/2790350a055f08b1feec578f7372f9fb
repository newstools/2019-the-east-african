Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta on Wednesday morning declared the terrorist attack at the 14 Riverside Drive over, with all the terrorists having been killed. He did not give the number of the gunmen that had stormed the DusitD2 Hotel and office complex in the leafy Nairobi neighbourhood of Westlands on Tuesday afternoon. "The security operation is over and all terrorists eliminated," he said, and thanked the security agencies for a “swift and quick” response. At least 14 people were killed, President Kenyatta told Kenyans during a press briefing from State House, Nairobi. More than 700 people were rescued from the hotel-office complex. Mr Kenyatta said Kenya will relentlessly pursue those involved in the attack. “We will seek out every person involved in the funding, planning and execution of this heinous act,” he said. “We will pursue them wherever they will be, until they are held to account." While assuring Kenyans and foreigners of their safety, the President promised to “continue every step to make our nation inhospitable to terrorist groups and their networks.” “I take note of Kenyans who took to social media to spread hope and criticise false information. You have shown the world bravery, patriotism and love,” Mr Kenyatta said. Shabaab Somalia-based Al Shabaab terrorist group claimed responsibility for the attack, which came exactly three years after a Kenyan army base in Somalia was overran by the militants killing dozen soldiers. Other recent terrorist attacks include Garissa University attack where at least 147 students died in April 2015 and the Westgate Mall attack in September 2013 in which at least 67 people were killed.   Security officers' advance comes after at least 50 people rescued from building on Wednesday morning. Nkurunziza says Gitega is more centrally placed than Bujumbura. Police caution the public of loud controlled explosions.
