Tanzania’s central bank has transferred the assets and liabilities of Bank M to Azania Bank, Deputy Governor Bernard Kibesse said on Tuesday. The Bank of Tanzania took over the management of Bank M in August saying it had critical liquidity problems and was unable to meet its obligations. “After acquiring the assets and liabilities of Bank M, Azania Bank will now have a capital of Tsh164 billion ($71.46 million), which is way above the minimum capital requirement of Tsh15 billion ($6.51 million),” Kibesse told a news conference. At the time it was put under administration, Bank M had an asset base of Tsh1 trillion ($434.33 million). “Bank M failed to meet liquidity requirements and could not meet its maturing obligations, hence the decision by the central bank to put the bank under administration,” Kibesse said. Tanzania’s financial services sector is dominated by lenders such as CRDB Bank and NMB Bank. In December, the International Monetary Fund said nearly half of Tanzania’s 45 banks were vulnerable to adverse shocks and risk insolvency in the event of a global financial crisis.   Kenyan lenders says no association with Tanzania's Bank M. Injured have been evacuated to hospitals as attackers "are holding up in the hotel."
