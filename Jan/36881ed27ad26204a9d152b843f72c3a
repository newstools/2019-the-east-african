Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir Thursday declared open the border with Eritrea after a year's closure. Addressing thousands of his supporters in Kassala city near Eritrea, President Bashir declared that the border would be re-opened immediately. “Here from Kassala, I announce the opening of the border with Eritrea. They are our brothers, the policies may divide us for sometime, but what brings us together is bigger because of the joint history and geography,” he said. Sudan closed the border in January 2018, and deployed thousands of troops to protect the region from alleged Eritrean threat. Step down President Bashir further vowed that he would not step down, unless through the ballot in 2020. “This government can’t be changed through the Facebook or the Whatsapp, the only way for the political change in Sudan is through the voting,” he vowed. Sudan has witnessed nationwide protests for six week, while the ruling party has pushed for constitutional amendments to pave the way for President Bashir's nomination for a third term.
