Uganda's First Lady Janet Museveni says her husband has been leading the country for the last three decades because "God chose him." Mrs Museveni, who is the Minister of Education, was speaking on Thursday during the launch of a water scheme in western Ntungamo District. “I have been telling people that it is God who has enabled President [Yoweri] Museveni to be in power for this while. Do not think it’s just the elections. God is the one who puts leaders in charge of the people,” she said.

The law previously required presidential contenders to be under the age of 75. Mr Museveni, who seized power in January 1986, once said that leaders who overstayed were the root of Africa's problems.
