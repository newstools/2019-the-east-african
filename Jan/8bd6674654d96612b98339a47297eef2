South Sudan authorities have banned media houses in the country from covering the unrest in Sudan. The South Sudan Media Authority acting director Mr Sapana Abuyi said on Monday that the demonstrations in the northern neighbour, now in their third week, were internal affairs. “The ongoing protests in Khartoum are internal issues affecting a friendly nation, the media in South Sudan should not write or broadcast instigative statements and comments about it,” Mr Abuyi said in a statement on Monday. The order follows a complaint by the Sudan embassy in Juba after Al Watan, an Arabic newspaper in Juba, run articles deemed to be supportive of the protests. The paper's Editor-in-Chief Mr Michael Christopher was summoned to explain the motive for publishing stories critical of President Omar al-Bashir's government. The South Sudan media regulator also ordered the newspaper to publish an official apology to the Sudanese embassy within 72 hours.
