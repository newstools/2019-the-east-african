Two children were killed and 50 other people wounded when an assailant threw a bomb at a wedding party in Khartoum, Sudan, police said Wednesday. In an apparently personal affair, the bomber struck in the southern district of Mayo, police spokesman General Hashim Abdelrahim said in a statement to AFP. "Someone threw a bomb at a wedding party on Tuesday night, in which two children have been killed and 50 others wounded," Abdelrahim said. "The police have arrested the culprit and all indications are that the issue is related to the wedding," he said, without giving the suspect's identity. Many residents of Mayo, an impoverished neighbourhood, are from Darfur and the Nuba mountains, while some are South Sudanese. Sudan has been swept by a month of protests and clashes with security forces that have left 26 people dead, according to officials.   For 50 years, Isaria Meli has been seeking the return of his grandfatherâ€™s skull. Death toll has risen to 443 people, up by more than 40 in the past ten days.
