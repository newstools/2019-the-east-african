A US air strike on Somalia’s Jilib region Tuesday killed one Al-Shabaab fighter, the US Africa Command has said. "We continue to place pressure on terrorist networks at the same time our Somali partners are making progress on the ground," said Maj Gen William Gayler, director of operations Africom. "These strikes certainly disrupt the network and remove terrorists from causing further harm." Mr Gayler added that no civilian was injured or killed in the airstrike. Africom also pledged to continue working together with its partners to transfer the responsibility for long-term security in Somalia from Amisom to Somali forces. “In support of the Federal Government of Somalia, US forces will use all effective and appropriate methods to assist in the protection of the Somali people, including partnered military counterterrorism operations with the Federal Government of Somalia, Amisom, and Somali National Army forces,” Africom added. The US army has stepped up its war of air strikes in Somalia since 2017.   UN investigators say crimes against humanity and other violations continuing with impunity. Some South African ministers have blamed criminality instead of xenophobia.
