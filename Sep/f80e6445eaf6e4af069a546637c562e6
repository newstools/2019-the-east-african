The Rwanda Civil Aviation Authority has granted Kenya-based Jambojet the rights to fly to the capital Kigali. In a statement to the media on Thursday, Jambojet Chairman Vincent Rague said: “We are pleased to have received this approval. Kigali is one of the routes we have been pursuing in our expansion plan. Once we have everything in place, we will begin operations.” Jambojet CEO Allan Kilavuka said the airline is expanding its fleet as it plans to fly to more destinations in Africa. The low-cost airline currently flies from Kenya’s capital Nairobi to Entebbe in Uganda, and to five Kenyan destinations – Eldoret, Kisumu, Malindi, Mombasa and Ukunda. The airline was launched in April 2014 and was recently awarded the IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA registration).   The ousted autocrat Zine died in exile in Saudi Arabia on Thursday.
