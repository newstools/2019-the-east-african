A popular radio station in Zambia has said it will no longer play South African music in protest against the xenophobic attacks that have been taking place in South Africa. "Hot FM will cease to play music by South African artists on our airwaves until further notice," the station said in a statement posted on Facebook. "All African nations, whether front-line states or not, stood by our South African kindred during their time of need and together we embraced ubuntu," Hot FM said, referring to the African concept of togetherness. During its fight against apartheid, South Africa's now-governing African National Congress (ANC) was based in Zambia. "Africa is one, and until such a time that our South African counterparts embrace ubuntu again, our stand will be with all our African brothers being attacked and terrorised in that country."
