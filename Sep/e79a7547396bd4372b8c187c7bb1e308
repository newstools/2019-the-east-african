South Sudan has urged the South African government to find peaceful ways to end the recurring xenophobic attacks against foreign nationals in that country. “We need them to resolve the issue through peaceful dialogue,” the spokesperson at South Sudan Ministry of Foreign Affairs Makol Mawien told The EastAfrican in a telephone interview. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation said South Africa is capable of ending the attacks which are plaguing the country. South Sudan opposition leader and presidential aspirant Suzanne Jambo called on the ruling African National Congress to not only punish the perpetrators of the violence but to also remind citizens “about African solidarity for South Africa pre- and post-apartheid.” She said the xenophobic attacks on black Africans in South Africa goes against the legacy of Nelson Mandela. However, she also took a swipe at the African National Congress and slammed it for failing to deliver services to South Africans. She called for unity among African states.   The decision followed the announcement of first cabinet since the ousting of Omar al-Bashir. A politician moves to court, arguing the Constitution was not followed.
