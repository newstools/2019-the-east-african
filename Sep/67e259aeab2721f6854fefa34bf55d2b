Kenya will host a leg of the prestigious World Rally Championship next year after an 18-year break. Announcing the 2020 calendar on Friday, world governing body of motorsport FIA said: "The addition of Kenya’s iconic Safari Rally, one of global motorsport’s legendary contests, means the WRC returns to Africa, the world’s second largest continent by size, for the first time since 2002." Kenya was admitted to the championship together with Japan and New Zealand. The inclusion of Kenya’s iconic Safari Rally follows a successful dress rehearsal in July at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani in the capital Nairobi. “It’s no secret we wanted to further globalise the series by incorporating more events outside Europe and we’ve achieved that next year with this exciting new-look calendar,” said Oliver Ciesla, managing director of WRC Promoter. It is the first time the WRC has included six continents—Europe, North America, South America, Asia, Africa and Australasia—in its 48-year history. “The return of Japan and Kenya provide a presence in the world’s largest two continents by size for the first time in more than two decades. The last time Asia and Africa appeared in the WRC together was 1999,” added Ciesla. Kenya will open the second half of the 14-part series from July 16-19, 2020.
