ABUJA, South Africa has apologised to Nigeria over attacks in which Nigerians and other foreigners were targeted. Nigeria repatriated some 187 citizens from South Africa following the violence, and plans to bring home many more. At the weekend, the South African presidency said President Cyril Ramaphosa would send high-ranking emissaries on a mission to reassure African countries after a wave of xenophobic attacks. On Monday, South Africa special envoy Jeff Radebe told President Muhammadu Buhari that the attacks on foreigners do not represent South Africa's “value system, nor those of the larger number of South Africans”. He said South Africa is committed to peace and integration of the continent. Mr Radebe said that during the attacks, 10 people – two Zimbabweans and eight South Africans – were killed, but no Nigerian was a casualty. He added that South Africa remains eternally grateful for the role Nigeria played in ending apartheid, and he hopes that the Nigerian president’s scheduled visit will solidify the relationship between the two countries. President Buhari said indeed Nigeria made great sacrifices for South Africa to become a free state. He thanked President Ramaphosa for sending the special envoy to apologise over the attacks.   Charles Kinuthia solicited money from Rwandans to attend his “Wealth Conference”. Nairobi promises to seek a stronger cooperation between the UN and regional bodies.
