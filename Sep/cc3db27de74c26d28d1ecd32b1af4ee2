At least eight people were killed on Sunday morning when a trailer collided with a passenger bus from Kenya in Nakawa, along the Jinja-Tororo highway, Uganda. The trailer was coming from the Kampala direction when it veered off the road and crashed into the Kampala-bound Modern Coast bus, witness Besweri Kawanguzi said. He was on his way to his farm at around 5.30am when he witnessed the accident. The injured were taken to various hospitals, including Bugiri, Iganga and Fast Line Medical Centre in Bugiri. Police took the bodies to Bugiri Hospital mortuary. The officer-in-charge of traffic at Bugiri Police Station, Mr Hopkins Twesiga, said the bus had 40 passengers on board and six of them were killed in the accident. The other two victims were the trailer driver and his passenger. “We are yet to identify the exact cause of the accident,” Mr Twesiga said.
