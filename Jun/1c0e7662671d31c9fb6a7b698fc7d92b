The United Kingdom (UK) government has for the first time appointed a woman as a British High Commissioner to Kenya. Ms Jane Marriott, the director of UK government’s Joint International Counter-Terrorism Unit, was Thursday announced as a successor of the outgoing envoy Nic Hailey. “Ms Marriott is the first woman to be appointed to the role. She brings a wealth of experience to the position, having worked across many UK government departments, including the foreign and commonwealth office, the Cabinet office, the home office and the Ministry of Defence,” read a statement sent to newsrooms by the British High Commission in Nairobi, and signed by Ms Alice Simpson, the head of communications. Ms Marriott previously served as Her Majesty’s ambassador to Yemen, and British deputy ambassador to Iran, and has also undertaken postings in the USA, Iraq and Afghanistan. Ms Marriott is expected to take up her appointment in September 2019. The High Commissioner is the UK government’s representative in a Commonwealth nation. They are responsible for the direction and work of the High Commission.   It has resumed its continental expansion plan that stalled three years ago. The people have become even more united especially after the June 3 killings.
