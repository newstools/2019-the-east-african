I recently went to Bwok Café and Bistro in Kigali, an offshoot of one of my favourite bakeries, RZ Manna. Bwok meets the needs of the sweet tooth, and also has Italian lunch and dinner options to add to its Korean roots. Bwok Café and Bistro is located in Gacuriro, inside the Kwetu Film School building. The interior has white exposed brick walls, and hardwood flooring. The beige dining chairs and the black décor on the walls give it a subtle elegance. The splash of colour on the children’s playground matches the colourful chairs in the restaurant. Bwok has exceptionally good service. The attendant welcomed me into the bistro warmly and brought out the menu as soon as I had settled down. The attendants were dressed in multi-coloured peaked flat caps. The overall ambience is inviting. I arrived at Bwok before midday with the intention of having brunch. Browsing through the breakfast options I settled for a fruit waffle and an Oreo milkshake. The fruit waffle was crunchy, rich and fluffy. It was baked just right—crisp on the outside and tender on the inside—and was served with slices of bananas, strawberries, pineapples and mangoes. The Oreo milkshake was refreshing as the day was hot. The vanilla ice-cream and chocolate sauce gave it a wonderful creamy texture and taste. I was a disappointed to find that they only serve burgers on Fridays and Saturdays, yet this was what I had been looking forward to eating. So I settled for the buffet, that costs Rwf7,800 ($8.5) per person. Bwok’s menu is similar to Rz Manna’s, particularly the smoothies, frappuccinos, various coffees and cold brews and the selection of milkshakes. Brunch is served on Friday and Saturday between 10:30am and 4pm. Bwok has great food but the limited menu depending on the day you go can be disappointing.   Maize, beans and cassava production has increased over the past three years. The crackdown on tax evasion has raised the sector’s contribution to GDP to 5pc.
