Sudan's Transitional Military Council (TMC) on Wednesday arrested rebel group leader Yasir Arman, accusing him of fuelling the protests in the crisis-hit state, credible sources confirmed. Mr Arman arrived in Khartoum two weeks ago and declared his support for a civilian-led government in Sudan. His arrest came a few days after he was summoned by Sudan's Intelligence agency. Last week the military junta asked Mr Arman to leave the Sudanese capital Khartoum but he did not heed the warning. Mr Arman is the secretary general of Sudan People's Liberation Army/ Movement-North (SPLM/A-N), an armed faction led by Malik Agar in the Blue Nile region. Sudan’s military council also accused Mr Arman of enjoying foreign support. Mr Arman faced a death sentence by a Sudanese court in 2011, due to his roles in the civil war that erupted in the Blue Nile and South Kordofan regions. In statement on May 29, 2019, Arman confirmed that the TMC has requested him to leave the country. “I received six requests, five of them from TMC deputy chairman and one from TMC chairman himself, ordering me to leave the country, but I will never implement that,” he said. -Additional reporting by Mohamed Amin   Plans to raze a section of forest sparks debate over land ownership and how it should be used.
