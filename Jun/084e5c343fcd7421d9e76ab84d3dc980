Tanzania's interior minister has told policemen to stop assaulting motorcycle taxi riders. Members of Parliament have complained that police are stopping the riders - known as boda boda drivers - over traffic offences and then beating them up. Minister Kangi Lugola told parliament: "Policemen are only allowed to give them a fine... but should not beat them or confiscate their motorcycles. "It is our responsibility to protect those youth who are trying to eradicate poverty and create employment for themselves." Following his announcement, boda boda drivers were happy that the issue was raised in Parliament but they are still worried that it will not have an effect on the police, reports the BBC's Aboubakar Famau. "This is a victory for all boda boda drivers in the country. We were tired of being arrested and our motorcycles being taken frequently", one driver told BBC Swahili.   The country counts an estimated 4.5 million internally displaced people. Stock exchanges have been struggling to attract new listings.
