A court has handed down death sentences to three men for the rape and murder of a 12-year-old. The court in Somalia's northern semi-autonomous state of Puntland acquitted seven others. The girl was abducted from a market in Galkayo town in February. Her body was discovered the next morning and a post-mortem found that she had been strangled to death after being gang-raped. The atrocity led to street protests as well as an angry reaction on social media with calls for the Puntland government to take action.   Protesters say they are determined to force the ruling military council to cede power. He was accused of rape and other sexual offences against two women.
