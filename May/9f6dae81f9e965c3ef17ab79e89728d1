The bodies of eight gold miners have been recovered following an explosion in a mine shaft in central Zimbabwe. The Ministry of Information says investigations are underway. In February, 24 illegal miners were killed when a dam burst, flooding a mine shaft just south of the capital. The miners are believed to have been working illegally in the South African-owned Jumbo mine. The Information ministry says initial indications are that some miners exploded dynamite in one shaft, causing a collapse in an adjacent one. Illegal mining has increased in Zimbabwe; as commercial miners scale down operations due to an economic crisis. The mining methods are rudimentary and safety standards largely disregarded.   It results from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed. Only one female left in the country as species edges closer to extinction.
