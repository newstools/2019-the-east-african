Mr Sisi was due to arrive in Zambia on Thursday for a two-day official visit. In a message to journalists, Zambian Presidential spokesperson Amos Chanda said President Sisi called President Edgar Lungu to inform him that he was unable to travel to Zambia as planned. A date was not given for the postponed visit. The two presidents were set to discuss, among other things, areas of cooperation between the two countries and how to maintain peace in their respective regions, Zambia’s Foreign Affairs minister Joseph Malanji told reporters during briefing earlier in the week.
