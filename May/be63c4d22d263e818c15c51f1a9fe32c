Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari and his deputy Prof Yemi Osinbajo were sworn in on Wednesday for a second term in office. The oath of office was administered by acting Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN) Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad at the Eagles Square in Abuja. The national and defence flags were hoisted to signify the commencement of the new dispensation, followed by a 21-gun salute. Twenty-nine out of the 36 governors of Nigeria were also sworn in. Buhari, the chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), emerged winner in the February presidential election with 15 million votes (56 percent) against his former Vice President Atiku Abubakar’s 11 million votes. Mr Abubakar, of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), challenged the outcome of the election at the Election Petition Tribunal, and the case is ongoing. Buhari, 76, is a former army general while his deputy Osinbajo, 62, was a senior advocate. They campaigned on the promise of making the country safer and rooting out corruption. Nigeria is currently grappling with reports of massive graft, and recurrent attacks in various areas, especially in the north.   The cabinet will be composed of 39 full ministers and about 12 assistant ministers. The US put Eritrea in the category in May 2017 for allegedly funding Al-Shabaab.
