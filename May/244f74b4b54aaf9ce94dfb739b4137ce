Ugandan musician-turned-politician Robert Kyagulanyi, alias Bobi Wine, has been granted bail. Buganda Road Court Grade One Magistrate, Ms Esther Nahirya, Thursday afternoon ordered Mr Kyagulanyi to pay a cash bail of Ush1 million ($265) as one of the bail conditions. The Kyaddondo East Member of Parliamenti is facing charges of disobedience of statutory duty. The prosecution said he committed the offence in July last year. His three sureties were each ordered to execute a non-cash bond of Ush10 million ($2,657). The sureties include Kassanda North MP, Mr Patrick Nsamba, Kasambya county MP, Mr Gafa Mbwatekamwa, and former Ethics minister, Ms Miria Matembe. Mr Kyagulanyi followed the proceedings from Luzira Prison via a video link. The court barred him from holding unlawful demonstrations as such activities would lead to cancellation of his bail. Mr Kyagulanyi was arrested on Monday as he travelled to the police Criminal Investigations Directorate (CID) in the capital Kampala for interrogation. Bobi Wine, his brother Mr Fred Nyanzi Ssentamu, and a one David Lule, another Edward Sebuwufu and others still at large, allegedly disobeyed lawful orders by holding an illegal protest contrary to section 116 of the Penal Code Act. The case will be heard on May 23.   Security heightened as video conferencing equipment set up in courtroom. Govt spokesperson says probe should start in Kenya where the pair were kidnapped.
