Uganda police has heightened security in the capital Kampala as Kyadondo East MP Robert Kyagulanyi aka Bobi Wine returns to Buganda Road Court for his bail hearing Thursday. Mr Kyagulanyi was arrested on Monday two days after he was released from being under house arrest. He is facing charges of disobedience of statutory duty. However, at the courtroom screens and video conferencing equipment has been set up, signalling that the MP may follow proceedings from his prison cell. The technology was launched last week to enable suspects attend court remotely. The prosecution says the singer-politician committed the offence, an allegedly illegal protest, in July 2018. He was arrested on Monday on his way to answer summons at the Criminal Investigations Directorate (CID) offices. Bobi Wine, his brother Mr Fred Nyanzi Ssentamu, and David Lule and Edward Sebuwufu among others still at large, allegedly disobeyed lawful orders by holding a protest contrary to section 116 of the Penal Code Act. The popular musician entered Parliament in 2017 and has emerged as a leading critic of President Yoweri Museveni. He has struck a chord with young Ugandans with his songs about social justice. Authorities have repeatedly blocked him from performing publicly. One of Wine's songs contains the lyric "freedom fighters become dictators," while others hint that President Museveni has stayed in power too long. The 74-year-old leader has ruled Uganda since seizing power at the head of a rebel army in 1986. He intends to stand for re-election to a sixth term in office in 2021. -Additional reporting by AFP.
