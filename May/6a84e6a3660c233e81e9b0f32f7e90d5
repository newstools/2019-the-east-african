She has been admitted at Life Care Hospital in Bungoma and is in stable condition. “I can confirm that the diplomat has been rushed to hospital, we are still gathering details from her driver on what might have caused the accident,” Bungoma County Commissioner Stephen Kihara told the Nation. The car has been towed to Bungoma Police Station.     The cabinet will be composed of 39 full ministers and about 12 assistant ministers.
