East Africa’s stockmarkets stayed on the downward path in the first three months of the year as local investors stayed away from the equity market and moved into government bonds to prevent value erosion with the falling share prices. Equity market reports for quarter one show that investors increased their appetite for Treasury bonds compared with shares, leaving foreign investors to dominate the equity market. Kenya’s Capital Market Authority reckons that the poor financial showing of most listed companies is likely to affect the performance of regional bourses this year as investors go for alternative investment options with better and stable returns such as bonds and real estate. The poor financial showing of publicly quoted companies became apparent when 15 companies trading shares on the Nairobi Securities Exchange issued profit warnings, meaning that their earnings for 2018 would fall by at least 25 per cent. “The reported slowdown in performance of listed companies is likely to affect the performance of capital markets in the short to medium-term,” CMA said in its latest Capital Markets Soundness report for quarter one that was released last week. PERFORMANCE Equity turnover on the Kenyan bourse declined 26 per cent to Ksh45.48 billion ($454.8 million) in the three months to March 31 this year, from Ksh61.15 billion ($611.5 million) over the same period last year, while volumes of shares traded fell 21.76 per cent to 1.67 billion from 2.13 billion in the same period. In Kenya, average foreign investor participation accounted for 74.91 per cent compared with 57.37 per cent in the same period last year. The Kenyan government during the same period issued seven Treasury-bonds seeking to raise Ksh152 billion ($1.52 billion) but the issues were oversubscribed by more than 80 per cent, having received bids worth Ksh276.22 billion ($2.76 billion). In Tanzania, the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange ended the month of March on a low note, with total turnover declining to $12,182, from $75,324 in February, according to analysts at the Africa-focused advisory firm StratLink. “Consequently the bourse stayed in the red with the key benchmark indices trending southwards,” the analysts said. Tanzania Breweries Ltd and the self-listed DSE were the top movers. Tanzania’s Industrial and Allied index fell 2.1 per cent to 4,883.9 points, the banking index declined 1.6 per cent to 2,103.9 points while the commercial services index fell 0.6 per cent to close at 2,255 points.
