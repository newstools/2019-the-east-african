South Sudan President Salva Kiir on Thursday visited former Kenyan leader Daniel Moi, family spokesmen said. Moi’s Press Secretary Lee Njiru said President Kiir visited the former head of state at his home in Kabarak, in Rift Valley region, to personally offer his condolences over the death of Jonathan Toroitich a month ago. “South Sudan President Salva Kiir today [Thursday] visited Mzee Moi at his Kabarak home to condole with him and his family...he met Mzee Moi and wished him and the family strength,” said Mr Njiru. Jonathan, 64, succumbed to cancer last month while undergoing treatment at a Nakuru hospital. Mr Njiru also said the meeting, which lasted nearly an hour, discussed and reviewed the peace and stability of South Sudan and the Horn of Africa in general. “President Kiir said South Sudan will be forever grateful to Mzee Moi for the key role he played in ensuring there is sustainable peace and stability in the country. Mzee Moi said he was happy with the relative peace in South Sudan and that a lot needs to be done to ensure there is lasting peace in the youngest country in East Africa,” added Mr Njiru. Kiir was accompanied by foreign minister Nhial Deng Nhial, director general external security Gen Thomas Doath and South Sudan Ambassador to Kenya Chol Mawut. He was received by Baringo Senator Gideon Moi, veteran South Sudan peace mediator Lt Gen (rtd) Lazarus Sumbeiywo and mining minister John Munyes. Earlier in the day, Kiir attended the 17th National Prayer Breakfast in Nairobi, an event that brings together leaders to reflect and pray for the nation.   A US-drafted resolution was adopted by a vote of 10 in favour with five abstentions. Move comes days after Juba called for embargo and restrictions on top officials to be lifted
