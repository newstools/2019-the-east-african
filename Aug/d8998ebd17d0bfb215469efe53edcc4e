South Sudan’s President Salva Kiir on Monday replaced his Foreign Minister Nhial Deng Nhial with his former Gender Minister Awut Deng Acuil as part of a minor tweak to his cabinet, a government spokesman said. Deng, who held the position for two years, has long been seen as Kiir’s right-hand man. It is unclear why he was fired. “I can confirm it that the president has made some changes in the government this evening”, Ateny Wek Ateny, the presidential spokesperson told Reuters. Kiir relieved Rebecca Joshua Okwaci from the Ministry of Roads and Bridges, and Jemma Nunu Kumba from Wildlife Conservation and Tourism. He also sacked the governors of Twic and Akobo, according to a statement read out on state television. —Additional reporting by John Adukata.
