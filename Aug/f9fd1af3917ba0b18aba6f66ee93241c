An appeal court in north-east Somalia has upheld the death sentence for three men convicted of raping and killing a 12-year-old girl. Aisha Ilyaas Aden was abducted, gang raped and killed near her home in Galkayo, in the semi-autonomous region of Puntland, in February. The case caused uproar and sparked demonstrations across the country. Ten suspects were initially arrested but the regional High Court found three of them guilty in May. Prosecutors said they relied on DNA evidence for the first time to convict them. The Puntland Supreme Court’s verdict is final. The death sentence will be carried out by firing squad once approved by the regional president. He has promised that his administration will take tough action against anyone found guilty of committing rape.   Ahmed Islam 'Madobe' was re-elected with 56 of 74 votes cast by regional MPs. Abdalla Hamdok vows to make achieving peace and solving the country’s economic crisis.
