Lusaka, Police in Zambia have arrested opposition leader Chishimba Kambwili on accusations of defaming President Edgar Lungu. He was arrested following a video that has gone viral in which the opposition leader is heard referring to government ministers, including President Lungu, in derogatory terms. The offence of defaming the President carries a prison sentence of a maximum of three years. Mr Kambwili, who was once a member of the governing Patriotic Front party before his dismissal and information minister, said his arrest is politically-motivated. He spoke to reporters after appearing to answer to a contempt of court charge and was driven back to the police station. Meanwhile, Mr Kambwili is also battling against the move to deregister his party, the National Democratic Congress.   The finding challenges a previously held belief about how humans evolved. PM says he will select technocrats based on their "competence".
