Tanzanian government on Friday said South African authorities have seized a jet belonging to state-owned carrier Air Tanzania. In a statement, Leonard Chamuriho, permanent secretary in the Ministry of Works,Â Transport and Communications, said the plane was "forced to cancel its flight from Oliver Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg to Dar es Salaam following an order issued by the Gauteng High Court". No reason was provided for the seizure. Mr Chamuriho added that the government had been informed by its ambassador in South Africa about the development. "We are working to ensure that the plane is released immediately," said Mr Chamuriho. Air Tanzania's managing director Ladislaus Matindi said the carrier had made arrangements for the affected passengers to board other airlines. The carrier on Saturday adjusted its flight schedule but did not link the move to the seizure of its aircraft. This is not the first time that Air Tanzania has run into trouble in South Africa. Last month, a the carrier's staff, journalists and a Tanzanian delegation were turned away at OR Tambo airport on its inaugural flight to Johannesburg. ATCL blamed "miscommunication" between the airport and immigration officials for the hitch. Air Tanzania revived flights to South Africa in June, a move aimed at bolstering relations and boosting tourism between the two countries.   Analysts say a strong political will is needed on both sides to enforce the agreement. The belief in him comes from the many senior positions he has held in various organisations.
