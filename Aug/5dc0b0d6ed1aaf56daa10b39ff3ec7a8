Violence against aid workers in conflict-torn South Sudan has reduced significantly, thanks to the September 2018 peace deal, a UN official said on Monday. Speaking during an occasion making the World Humanitarian Day, Alain Noudehou, humanitarian coordinator in South Sudan said there has been improvement in security for aid workers in the past one year. "We are grateful that since the start of year 2019, we have not experienced any loss of life in the humanitarian community," Noudehou said. He urged the parties to the peace agreement to implement it and bring lasting stability to the world's youngest nation. The UN envoy also called for increased efforts to address the risks faced by female aid workers who often face risks of sexual violence and discrimination."Our hope is that the security situation will continue to improve to allow people to start to rebuild their lives," Noudehou said. South Sudan was ranked the most dangerous place to deliver aid, according to the Worker Security Report for 2018. At least 112 humanitarian workers have been killed since South Sudan descended into civil war in late 2013, said Manasseh Lomole, chairperson of the South Sudan Relief and Rehabilitation Commission. South Sudan descended into civil war in late 2013 and the conflict has created one of the fastest growing refugee crises in the world. The United Nations estimates that about four million South Sudanese have been displaced internally and externally. A peace deal signed in August 2015 collapsed following renewed violence in the capital in July 2016. Under the latest peace deal, opposition leader Riek Machar will be reinstated as Kiir's deputy.
