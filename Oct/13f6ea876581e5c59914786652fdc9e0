Ugandan police have surrounded the home of the Kyadondo East MP Robert Kyagulanyi alias Bobi Wine to block him from heading to his “One Love Beach” in Busabala, in the capital Kampala, where he had planned to hold a concert. Armed officers were stationed at the two entrances to Bobi Wine’s home in Wakiso District and barricades were placed on the road leading to his home. Officers inspected every vehicle that went in or out of the com-pound, and some vehicles were not allowed access into the home. Neighbours told Daily Monitor that the police laid siege to the home last night at around 10.30pm. “When I was coming home last night, I found this roadblock and they stopped me. I explained to them that I was heading home and that is when they left me to continue,” Mr Dennis Kamoga said. Bobi Wine tweeted: “Since 11.00pm, police and military surrounded my home and my private property, One Love Beach Busabala, in yet another move to place me under house arrest and block our Independence Day music concert. 156th concert so far! For singing truth to power, I can't per-form in my own country.” On Tuesday evening, police issued a statement indicating that the musician turned politician was not allowed to hold his Osobola concert at his ‘One Love Beach’ in Busabala property, saying they were concerned about public security at the concert. However, Bobi Wine remained adamant that the concert would go on as planned. Kampala Metropolitan police spokesperson Patrick Onyango last evening warned the public not to go to the concert venue. “If you want peace, stay at your homes because there will be no concert tomorrow. Don’t waste your valuable time please,” Mr Onyango said in a telephone interview on Tuesday.   It's now only transmitting within an area of eastern DRC, but the danger is not over.
