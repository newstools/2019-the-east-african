Rwandan security forces killed 19 suspected terrorists blamed for a weekend attack that left 14 dead near the Volcanoes National Park, famous for its mountain gorilla sanctuary. The police said five of the "terrorists" were arrested after they attacked people in their homes with knives, machetes and stones in Musanze District. Officials suspect that the attackers carried out the killings while searching for food. While the death toll was initially put at eight, authorities are now saying that 14 people were killed. Tourism officials insisted Saturday that all visitors to the park were safe.   The first made-in-Rwanda phones rolled off the assembly line last week. Mariam Mweke, 36, was arrested in Mumbai after a seven-month hunt by police in India.
