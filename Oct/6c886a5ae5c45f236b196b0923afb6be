The Tanzanian government has opened a bank account in which those accused of economic sabotage, and have asked for an amnesty, can return the money. This follows an announcement by the public prosecutor, Biswalo Mganga, about those charged with tax evasion, money laundering and other financial crimes. Mr Mganga has said that 467 people charged with economic sabotage had pledged to return stolen money to the state in exchange for having the charges dropped. President John Magufuli extended the amnesty to October 6 from an initial deadline of 29 September. The prosecutor told journalists on Thursday that the government has opened a "special bank account at the Bank of Tanzania". He said those who want to be pardoned will have to deposit the money into the account after approval by court, The Citizen newspaper reports.
