At least 54 Tanzanian police officers were demoted between January and June 2019 over lack of discipline, the country's Inspector General of Police (IGP) Simon Sirro has revealed. Sirro on Monday told President John Magufuli that 157 other police officers had been served with warnings during the period under review. President Magufuli was commissioning 20 housing units for police officers in Geita region, northwestern of the country. The police chief said that some of the demoted police officers were implicated in wrongfully implicating people in crime deeds, conspiring with criminals and causing problems to civilians. In response, President Magufuli directed the IGP to continue taking disciplinary measures against police officers who acted contrary to the ethics of the police force. "Keep on being strict on the observation of discipline in the police force," Magufuli told Sirro. The event was broadcast live by state-owned Tanzania Broadcasting Corporation (TBC).
