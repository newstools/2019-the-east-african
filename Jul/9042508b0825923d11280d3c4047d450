OTTAWA, The Canadian army is probing the theft of highly sensitive information from a military research centre by a former employee, media reports said Tuesday. The now-retired civilian specialising in ballistics is suspected of having stolen and destroyed some 30,000 files containing highly sensitive information, public broadcaster Radio-Canada reported. The employee has not been formally charged. A spokesman for Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan told AFP that a probe is underway but declined to comment further. A court document seen by Radio-Canada says military police obtained a search warrant for a highly restricted area within a research facility run by Defence Research and Development Canada, located near a military base outside Quebec City. This document says files were copied and then erased, such as photos of ballistic test results, videos of ballistic trials and munitions procurement records, Radio-Canada said. The former employee under suspicion reportedly committed an act of insubordination before leaving his job with the army last year, Radio-Canada said. He was reported by three former colleagues, it said.   Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman also oerdered to pay back $12.6b of the proceeds of his crimes. Michael Christopher seized aboard KQ flight for publishing content critical of the govt.
