The contested Abyei administrative area at the Sudan-South Sudan border has appealed to the United Nation Interim Security Forces for Abyei (UNISFA) to scale up security measures to protect residents from attacks. On Tuesday, armed men killed at least seven people in Abyei market, including a UN peacekeeper and a six-month-old baby. Abyei Area Chief Administrator Kuol Alor Jok Friday told The EastAfrican that more than 15 people have been killed between January 1 and July 16 this year. He described the Tuesday incident as “horrific”, adding that authorities are still trying to identify the attackers. “This time, the number of the victims is higher,” Mr Jok said. He urged the UNISFA to help stop the crimes. The UNISFA ensures safety and security of people in the area as stipulated in the Abyei Protocol. Mr Jok also called for cooperation between the residents and the UN keepers in dealing with insecurity. “We try to work hand in hand with the UN troops to ensure safety and security of the people in the area,” he added. The UN forces were sent to Abyei in 2011 by the UN Security Council following heightening tensions between northern and southern Sudan over the control of the area.   Rwanda says strong surveillance system in place that helps to prevent its entry. President says many people are awaiting trial indefinitely who should not be incarcerated.
