Safaricom has appointed former CEO Michael Joseph on an interim basis. The company held a special board meeting on July 1, 2019 following the death of CEO Bob Collymore early the same morning. Mr Collymore died at his home on Monday following a long battle with cancer. He leaves a rich legacy behind. In a statement dated July 1,2019 and signed by company secretary Kathryne Maundu, Safaricom said: "The Board is confident that during this transition, Mr Joseph will provide the necessary guidance and leadership to the Company and its employees." He will hold the position "until the board communicates in due course, on a permanent appointment." Mr Joseph, a US citizen, has been the chairman of Kenya Airways since 2016, and shareholders extended his term for another three years during the June 10, 2019 AGM. Mr Joseph left Safaricom in October 2010 after a 10-year stint at the helm of the company and was replaced by Mr Collymore who held the position until his demise. During Mr Joseph's time, subscribers grew from about 16,000 when he joined to more than 15 million when he was leaving. Revenues also grew, making Safaricom among the largest publicly listed telephone companies in Africa.   Rashid Charles Mberesero, a Tanzanian, gets life sentence.
