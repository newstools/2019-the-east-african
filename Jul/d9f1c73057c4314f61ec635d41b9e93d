Tanzaniaâ€™s High Court has ruled that there is not enough evidence to challenge the death penalty, which means that it will remain in place. Human rights activists had filed a complaint saying it is unconstitutional as it breaches the right to life. Nobody has been executed in Tanzania since 1994. Some 500 convicts in Tanzania's jails face the death penalty or have seen their sentences changed to life prison terms. More than 10 African countries across Africa still have the death penalty.   President says many people are awaiting trial indefinitely who should not be incarcerated. WHO has declared Ebola outbreak 'health emergency' of international concern.
