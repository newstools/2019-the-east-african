LONDON, Authorities in London will conduct a post mortem on the man who fell from a Kenya Airways flight on Sunday. The manâ€™s identity still remains unknown even as Kenya High Commission in London, the Metropolitan Police and Kenya Airways work to establish who he was. His death is not being treated as suspicious, but investigations are ongoing. A plane spotter saw the man falling from the flight as it approached Heathrow Airport and the police were alerted. The body landed just a few feet from a man asleep in his back garden in Clapham. According to witnesses, the body was frozen and nearly intact, but a lot of blood was found all around the garden it fell on. The man had all of his clothes on after his 3,500 foot fall. Ambulance and police services arrived quickly on the scene and Scotland Yard said later: "At this point, we believe the man was a stowaway and had fallen from the landing gear of an inbound Kenya Airways flight to Heathrow Airport." A bag, water and some food were discovered in the landing gear compartment once the Kenyan flight landed at the airport. This is not the first time such an event occurred. In 2012, Jose Matada, 26, from Mozambique, died after falling from a Heathrow-bound British Airways originating from Angola.   Raphael Ongangi found in Mombasa, his wife confirms. Trade has been severely disrupted since February when Rwanda abruptly closed Katuna border.
