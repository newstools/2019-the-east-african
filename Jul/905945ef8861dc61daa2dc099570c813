Eritrea, the only country that has not joined the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) which was launched over the weekend ,says it will seriously consider joining the pact that aims at removing tariffs on mpore than 90 per cent of commodities traded among African countries. Nigeria and Benin signed the agreement during the heads of state summit in Niemey, Niger where the nations agreed to shared rules of origin, the monitoring and elimination of non-tariff barriers, a unified digital payments system and an African trade observatory dashboard. The zone comes into operation in July 2020, giving countries time to adopt to the changes and to agree on rules of origin for critical sectors like textiles and the automotive sectors. Countries have a period of up to 15 years to phase down tariffs under a schedule determined by the level of development.
