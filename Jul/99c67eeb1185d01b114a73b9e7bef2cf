They stand accused of trying to "help return the former National Congress Party's regime to power," according to the military statement. General Mohamed Othman al-Hussein, the new head of joint chiefs of staff, also announced the details of the arrests on state television. The attempted coup came as the ruling military council which took over after Bashir's ouster in April negotiated a power sharing deal with protest leaders to form a joint civilian-military governing body. The accord was signed on July 17 but the two sides are yet to thrash out some key pending issues, including accountability for demonstrators killed during months of protests.   President Biya in a tweet described the champions as the “Pride of Cameroon.”
