Kenya will take stock of the number of intersex people during a national census set for next month in a big win for a group that has suffered discrimination and embarrassment in equal measure. In one case a Supreme Court judge has now apologised for ordering an intersex person to be detained in a cell for males where the person was molested. The recognition of a third gender is expected to lead to development of policies sensitive to the plight of intersexuals who are estimated to constitute between 1.7 per cent to three per cent of births. That would put their number in Kenya at about 1.4 million people.
