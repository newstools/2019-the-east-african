Uganda has advised cargo trucks heading to Rwanda to use two of its three border posts amid soaring relations with its neighbour. The travel advisory comes more than a week after Kigali announced that it had closed the Katuna/Gatuna border, the busiest crossing between Rwanda and Uganda. “Goods destined to Rwanda from Uganda consider exiting into Rwanda via Mirama Hills [Kagitumba] and Kyanika [Cyanika] Customs border posts; goods in Uganda territory, destined for the DRC consider exiting via Customs border posts shared by Uganda and DR Congo” reads a statement by Trade minister Amelia Kyambadde. Cargo trucks headed to the Democratic Republic of Congo that use the Rwandan route, which is shorter, and are stuck at Katuna now have three options -- the Bunagana border some 113km away, Ishasha 120km, and Mpondwe 255km. Kampala has also urged traders who already had Customs clearance for goods headed to Rwanda to contact the Uganda Revenue Authority for review. Ms Kyambadde noted that movement of Ugandans to and from Rwanda “remains unimpeded”. Rwanda blocked its nationals from crossing into Uganda last week on claims that they would be arrested, tortured and harassed. Kigali also accuses Kampala of hosting rebels seeking to destabilise Rwanda. Uganda says the accusations are false.   Uganda says it cannot allow anyone to threaten its neighbour within its territory. The woman, the first to convicted of FGM in UK, will spend 13 years behind bars.
