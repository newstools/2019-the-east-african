The defeated main opposition candidate in Nigeria’s presidential elections filed a legal challenge on Monday to last month’s vote. Atiku Abubakar’s petition said that he, the candidate for the People’s Democratic Party, had beaten the All Progressives Congress’s Muhammadu Buhari, who was elected to a second term on February 23. “We asked that our candidate who won the election massively across the country be declared the winner,” said Emmanuel Enoidem, a legal advisor to Atiku. The petition asks that the electoral commission overturns the result “on the grounds of irregularities,” Enoidem said. Buhari’s campaign has rejected Atiku’s allegations, saying the vote was free and fair. Buhari, the 76-year-old former military ruler, took 56 per cent of the vote against 41 per cent for Atiku, a businessman and former vice president.   Opposition leader Atiku Abubakar vows to challenge the "sham" result in court. Data from the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder is now in Addis Ababa. The food was part of a community feeding programme in northeast Karamoja region.
