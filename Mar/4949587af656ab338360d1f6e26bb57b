The African Union has called on all sides in Comoros to "show the greatest restraint" amid violence and a political crisis in the wake of disputed elections. AU commission chief Moussa Faki Mahamat said he was "concerned about the deterioration of the political and security climate" on the Indian Ocean archipelago, in statement released late Friday. Comoros is in the grip of a political crisis following President Azali Assoumani's victory in March 24 polls, that his opponents say was rigged and led rivals to unite against him. Mr Mahmat added he "deplores the violence that resulted in loss of life." Violence broke out in the Indian Ocean nation after a defeated presidential candidate bidding to unseat the president was arrested. Comoros has had a volatile political history since independence in 1975 and has endured more than 20 attempted coups, four of which were successful. President Assoumani initially came to power in a coup, then ruled the country between 1999 and 2006, and was re-elected in 2016. Both observers and community groups have questioned the credibility of the election, which saw Azali declared the winner with almost 61 percent of the vote.   President Azali Assoumani was declared the winner in Sundayâ€™s election. Leaders meet and make right diplomatic noises but deep unease remains.
