Award-winning Egyptian photojournalist Mahmoud Abu Zeid was released on Monday after spending nearly six years in prison following his arrest while covering a bloody crackdown on protests. The photographer, widely known as Shawkan, faces five years of strict supervision and will be required to spend every night sleeping at his local police station, but he vowed to resume his work. Last year Shawkan received Unesco's World Freedom Prize for his "courage, resistance and commitment to freedom of expression," dismaying the Egyptian authorities who accused him of "terrorist and criminal acts". Speaking at his home in Giza, he said the first moments of his release felt "as if I was flying." Can never forget Imprisonment "was an experience that I can never forget," the 31-year-old told AFP. "It's bitter but it lets one look at life from a different perspective, a new perspective that one can't see except from this place," he said. He is determined to return to his career despite the restrictions placed on him, saying: "I will continue my work as a photojournalist in Egypt." His mother fears his journalism will expose him to more risk. A bloodbath "As a mother I always urge him to stay out of trouble... but he always says journalism is in my blood," said 61-year-old Reda Mahrous. The Committee to Protect Journalists called on the Egyptian authorities "to end their shameful treatment of this photojournalist by removing any conditions to his release". Shawkan said he would take legal steps to try to end the restrictions. He was detained in August 2013 while covering clashes between security forces and supporters of ousted Islamist president Mohamed Morsy that turned into a bloodbath in which hundreds of demonstrators died.
