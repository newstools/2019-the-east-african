Ethiopian air crash investigators have returned to Addis Ababa from Paris where they had reviewed the black box data from a doomed Ethiopian Airlines jet, two sources familiar with the investigation told Reuters on Tuesday. Data from the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder is now in Addis Ababa, one of the sources said on condition of anonymity. The crash of the Boeing Co 737 MAX 8 airliner last week killed all 157 people on board and prompted regulators to ground the model pending more information from the investigation.   Both planes reportedly experienced erratic steep climbs. Detectives camp at a Barclays Bank branch in Nairobi. The voices of the pilots could reveal what led to the March 10 crash of the Boeing 737 MAX.
