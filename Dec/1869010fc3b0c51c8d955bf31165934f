DROP IN TURNOVER Despite the increased local participation at the bourse, the total turnover recorded from October to December was less by Tsh12.9 billion ($5.61 million) than in the same period last year. “With 13 days remaining for the quarter to end, total turnover as of December 17 was Tsh30.003 billion ($12.925 million), which is lower than the total turnover of Tsh42.912 billion ($18.487 million) recorded from October to December 2018,” the bourse reported. Total domestic market capitalisation decreased to Tsh9.010 billion ($3.9 million) from Tsh9.696 billion ($4.177 million) as of December 31, 2018. According to the DSE, this was largely due to falling share prices at six out of 21 counters following pressure to sell from both local and foreign investors.
