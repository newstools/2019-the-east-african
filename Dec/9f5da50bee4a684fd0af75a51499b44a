Kenyan former international sprinter John Anzrah is admitted at the Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) private wing in teh capital Nairobi after he suffered a stroke on Tuesday morning. Anzrah's sister-in-law Skastina said he was taken to Nairobi West Hospital and later referred to KNH where doctors discovered that he was bleeding in his brain. Skastina said Anzrah fell ill while in town and a Good Samaritan called them. Anzrah is responding well to treatment and several tests have been conducted on him. "Anzrah has been talking to us and responding well as we await further action from the doctors," Skastina said. Anzrah is a brother to the late football legend Joe Kadenge, who passed on early this year. He is also the brother of former international sprinter and coach Esther Kavaya. Anzrah, who is now into coaching, first represented Kenya at the 1983 World Championships where he competed in 4x100m and 4x400m relays in Helsinki, Finland. He would then take the blocks in 400m at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games before competing in 200m at the 1987 World Indoor Championships. Anzrah made a return to the 1987 World Championships competing in 400m and also represented Kenya at the African Games, former All Africa Games, the same year.   The deal will see 'Visit Rwanda' branding displayed at PSG's home ground Parc des Princes.
