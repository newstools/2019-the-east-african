Twenty-two people have been killed and hundreds missing following floods and landslides in western Uganda. River Tokwe also burst its banks, further displacing more people in the area. Bundibugyo District chairperson Ronald Mutegeki said on Sunday that several people are still missing. “It’s a very terrible and unfortunate situation. A lot of property including crops and houses have been destroyed, bridges have been washed away, roads submerged paralysing the transport network,” he said. This has forced many displaced residents to seek refuge in schools and churches, Mr Mutegeki said. He urged people living in areas prone to floods and landslides to relocate to safer areas. Bwamba County MP Richard Gafabusa on Saturday said the government has been informed to urgently distribute relief support to the affected communities.   Its democratic credentials are increasingly under scrutiny. At the Kusi Ideas Festival, leaders urged to champion equal access to opportunities for all.
